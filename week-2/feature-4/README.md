## Description of the Feature
Many developers love to use `appearance: none` to customize the styling of default elements such as the `select` shown in the demo. It turns of the platform-native styling from the OS.

## Fallback
The `appearance: none` property isn't that wel supported. In most of the current browsers only with a `prefix`. If the browser doesn't know the `appearance` property it shows the default browser styling.
